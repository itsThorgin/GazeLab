# GazeLab

**GazeLab** is a one-of-a-kind (yeah, because I only made one) eye-tracking trainer for FPS gamers who want that *extra training*. Just follow your target through eight levels, purely with your eyes.

The levels are designed to keep you alert, relaxed, focused and mildly irritated (all at the same time).

You’ve all heard it or said it: *“That was a headshot!”* - but no dmg or *“I've hit him three times!”* - but no dmg. Well, now you might actually be able to pinpoint the pixels you were aiming at correctly. Or not - maybe you just like yelling. Who knows.

We're here to fight those sly little shifts in your gaze - the ones tricking your brain into thinking you're dead-on target while your crosshair is a tiny bit off. GazeLab helps your eyes, brain and hands coordinate better.

**Important tip:** Don’t force your eyes. Let them glide naturally after acquisition flicks. Relax your face, neck, shoulders, and arms. The goal? Keep your gaze on the center dot. At least half of your training sesh should feel smooth and effortless.

## How It Helps

### Smooth pursuit = brain gains
Tracking moving targets with your eyes - known as **smooth pursuit** - activates visual-motor pathways, improves trajectory prediction, and could boost eye-hand coordination. Practicing this kind of movement can actually help you react faster in dynamic environments (games).  

### Breathing & slow visuals = chill
Meditation mode slows it all down - pastel colors, 4-second inhale / 6-second exhale rhythm, and a pulsing circle. This isn’t fluff: controlled breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, reducing heart rate, cortisol, and improving focus and emotional regulation. Watching slow, predictable visuals also reduces anxiety and improves sustained attention.

### Stripes = focus
Those transparent or solid overlay stripes? Not just eye candy. Visual textures help reduce strain and support **optokinetic pursuit** - essentially giving your eyes reference points to track moving objects more efficiently. They're good for your focus and tracking accuracy.

## How It Works (aka *The Menu*)

Press `M` or hit the button to summon the glorious, over-engineered 3-column settings menu.

### Column 1 - Display & Aesthetics

- **Resolution picker**: FHD / QHD / 4K (higher resolution = faster target movement because, y’know, pixels/sec).
- **Color customization**: Target, dot, background, flash color.
- **Toggles**: Flash cue, level auto-switching, hashtag overlay, vertical/horizontal stripes (solid or transparent). Yes, this is real.

### Column 2 - Difficulty Master

- **Tier + sublevel selector**: 16 tiers, each with 10 sublevels.
- **Advanced speed tuning**: Manually override level speeds + a reset button, whoa.

### Column 3 - Finetuning

- **Speed adjustment increment**: Pick from 0.5% to 5% steps.
- **Manual speed control**: + / - buttons or direct input.
- **Target size control**: Same deal.
- **Level info**: View current level number, name, and jump forward/backward.
- **Round duration**: Set in seconds.
- **Timers**: Total elapsed time & current round time.

## The 8 Levels - Eye Agility Tour

**Round preset** is 30 seconds, so all 8 levels = 4 minutes. I recommend doing **3 full rounds daily** (12 mins). Just a suggestion.

The idea: Train at speeds where you can confidently track the *center dot* of the target 90%+ of the time. Let your eyes glide naturally. No strain. No forcing. Use your eye muscles *as little as possible*. They *know* how to track - don’t micromanage them. Flick your sight only when switching targets or regaining lost tracking and then return to smooth, strain-free gliding.

Also: occasionally train at much **slower** and **faster** speeds. Combining the slower, faster, and 'sweet spot' speeds works best for me.

### The Levels:

1. **LR - Level 1** - Left ↔ right, random vertical offset.  
2. **UD - Level 2** - Up ↕ down, with horizontal offset.  
3. **Spiral - Level 3** - Spirals in random size/direction. Clockwise or not? Who knows.  
4. **Sideways Fig 8 - Level 4** - Figure-eight, but sideways, random size & starting point.  
5. **Fig 8 - Level 5** - Same as above, just upright, amazing.  
6. **Bounce - Level 6** - Edge bounces at unpredictable angles. Sometimes bounces straight back, wild.  
7. **Clock Hands - Level 7** - Target slides out from center and follows "clock hands" path. Randomized travel length & direction.  
8. **Peek Simulator - Level 8** - Target pops from behind cover. High, low, left, right. Can fake peek or wide peek.

All with touch of **randomness**.

## Meditation Mode

Activate **Meditation Mode** via menu. Here’s what changes:

- Only Levels 1, 2, 6 used (aka the chill ones)
- All movement is slowed way down
- 60-second rounds with auto-switching
- Pastel-night calming color theme
- Inhale/exhale visual guide (4s/6s)

### Why?
Controlled breathing:
- Lowers cortisol  
- Activates parasympathetic response  
- Sharpens attention  
- Reduces anxiety

## Why This Works

- **Smooth pursuit training** improves eye-brain-hand sync.
- **Overlay stripes** enhance focus and tracking with optokinetic cues.
- **Breathing + slow visuals** reduce stress and improve cognitive performance.
- **Random patterns** prevent your eyes from “cheating” or memorizing paths.

> Still, in-game practice, team strategies and clear communication, reviewing pro tips, metas etc should be your priority.

> This is just training - it works for me, might work for you.

> Enjoy.
